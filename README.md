# minesweeper-swing

## About 
This application is built as a fun project for implementation of the classic Minesweeper Game with Java Swing API. There may be possible bugs.

Each Minesweeper game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares. After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them. It's your job to use the numbers to figure out which of the blank squares have mines and which are safe to click.

Minesweeper is similar to a Sudoku puzzle in that your success is largely contingent on being able to eliminate possible answers until only one answer remains.

## Instructions to Play the game
- The mouse is the only tool that you'll need to play Minesweeper.
- The left mouse button is used to click squares that don't contain mines, while the right mouse button is used to flag squares that contain mines.
- The first square that you click will never have a mine beneath it. Clicking a square will clear off some of the board while numbering other squares.
- A number on a square refers to the number of mines that are currently touching that square.
- **To win the game, flag all the squares that have mines beneath them.**
